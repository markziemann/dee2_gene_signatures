## Background

This analysis is an example of how gene signatures can be generated from publicly available omics data.
In this example, we will obtain data from the [DEE2](http://dee2.io) database, perform differential analysis with DESeq2 and then return the gene signature. 

```{r,setup}
source("de_functions.R")
```


```{r,study_list,fig.width=8,fig.height=8}
# let's assume species is human for now
SPECIES = "hsapiens"

# read in the file
x <- readLines("epilepsy.md")

# this is the best way to get studies with contrasts set up
x <- x[grep("RP",x)]

# how many contrasts to do?
length(x)

# lets prototype this by 
main(x[[3]])

data <- sapply(x,main)
```
