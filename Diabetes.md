## Studies that fit criteria

GSE137136: control vs cytokine

GSE52314: RNAs of human islets cells from diabetic vs control

GSE139929: HepG2 cells treated with astragalus polysaccharide and berberine vs control HepG2 cells

GSE141126: palmitic acid treatment conjugated to BSA vs BSA alone as control

GSE143143: all cells stimulated or unstimulated are monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Healthy donors unstimulated, healthy donors stimulated with healthy donor neutrophil extracellular traps, healthy donors stimulated with Type 1 diabetes neutrophil extracellular traps  vs Type 1 diabetes unstimulated, Type 1 diabetes stimulated with healthy donor neutrophil extracellular traps, Type 1 diabetes  stimulated with Type 1 diabetes neutrophil extracellular traps

GSE53949: pancreatic islet under palmitate exposure vs under control conditions

GSE140627: Gene regulation in type 1 diabetes renal function decliners and non renal function decliners

GSE57896*: Obesity combated through conversion of white to brown adipocytes with different gene expression regulated using inhibitors of molecules that do the reverse of this conversion. Add BAT vs WAT.

GSE60424*: Gene regulation comparison between control and different immune-associated diseases. (unsure how many to use and the comparisons which should be chosen)

GSE67543*: Alpha vs Beta and fetal vs adult contrasts

GSE69889*: mice and human data. Can just use human data. Seems diabetes related. Gene expression differentiated according to molecular clock.

GSE76268: Gene expression differences between glucagon-secreting α-cells and insulin-secreting β-cells.

GSE77108: Gene expression regulated by HDAC inhibitors, in this case, SAHA, ep300 siRNA and C646 in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

GSE77522: Gene expression regulated by treatment with metaformin in normoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic conditions

## Studies that don't fit criteria

GSE137803: no replicates

GSE136053: no sample descriptions

GSE137317: no replicates 

GSE139073: not related to diabetes

GSE51310: no replicates

GSE51924: no replicates

GSE140064: no replicates

GSE55567: no replicates

GSE63887?: no clear differentiation between datasets (i.e. no ctrl vs study or something like this) and therefore contrast doesn't seem possible without another study or more data

GSE67141: not directly related to diabetes also no replicates

GSE76308: no replicates

GSE58557: not related to diabetes
