## Studies that fit criteria

GSE137136: control vs cytokine

GSE52314: RNAs of human islets cells from diabetic vs control

GSE139929: HepG2 cells treated with astragalus polysaccharide and berberine vs control HepG2 cells

GSE141126: palmitic acid treatment conjugated to BSA vs BSA alone as control

GSE143143: all cells stimulated or unstimulated are monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Healthy donors unstimulated, healthy donors stimulated with healthy donor neutrophil extracellular traps, healthy donors stimulated with Type 1 diabetes neutrophil extracellular traps  vs Type 1 diabetes unstimulated, Type 1 diabetes stimulated with healthy donor neutrophil extracellular traps, Type 1 diabetes  stimulated with Type 1 diabetes neutrophil extracellular traps

GSE53949: pancreatic islet under palmitate exposure vs under control conditions

GSE140627: Gene regulation in type 1 diabetes renal function decliners and non renal function decliners

GSE57896?: Obesity combated through conversion of white to brown adipocytes with different gene expression regulated using inhibitors of molecules that do the reverse of this conversion.

GSE60424?*: Gene regulation comparison between control and different immune-associated diseases. (unsure how many to use and the comparisons which should be chosen)

GSE67543?*: No clear differentiation between datasets. Contrasts can be made with the datasets given though. Unclear which would be useful.

GSE58557?*: no clear differentiation between datasets (i.e. no ctrl vs study or something like this). Can derive contrasts from datasets however many do not have sufficient replicates and unsure which would be useful.

GSE69889?*: mice and human data. Can just use human data. Seems diabetes related. Gene expression differentiated according to molecular clock.

GSE76268: Gene expression differences between glucagon-secreting α-cells and insulin-secreting β-cells.

GSE77108: Gene expression regulated by HDAC inhibitors, in this case, SAHA, ep300 siRNA and C646 in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

GSE77522: Gene expression regulated by treatment with metaformin in normoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic conditions

## Studies that don't fit criteria

GSE137803: no replicates

GSE136053: no sample descriptions

GSE137317: no replicates 

GSE139073: not related to diabetes

GSE51310: no replicates

GSE51924: no replicates

GSE140064: no replicates

GSE55567: no replicates

GSE63887?: no clear differentiation between datasets (i.e. no ctrl vs study or something like this) and therefore contrast doesn't seem possible without another study or more data

GSE67141: not directly related to diabetes also no replicates

GSE76308: no replicates
