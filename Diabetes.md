## Studies that fit criteria

GSE137136: control vs cytokine

GSE52314: RNAs of human islets cells from diabetic vs control

GSE139929: HepG2 cells treated with astragalus polysaccharide and berberine vs control HepG2 cells

GSE141126: palmitic acid treatment conjugated to BSA vs BSA alone as control

GSE143143*: looks replicated but not clear. all cells stimulated or unstimulated are monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Healthy donors unstimulated, healthy donors stimulated with healthy donor neutrophil extracellular traps, healthy donors stimulated with Type 1 diabetes neutrophil extracellular traps  vs Type 1 diabetes unstimulated, Type 1 diabetes stimulated with healthy donor neutrophil extracellular traps, Type 1 diabetes  stimulated with Type 1 diabetes neutrophil extracellular traps

GSE53949: pancreatic islet under palmitate exposure vs under control conditions
