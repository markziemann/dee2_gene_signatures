# DEE2 gene signatures

DEE2 is the world's largest set of processed RNA-seq data (http://dee2.io).
We made use of this dataset by curating human disease related data into gene sets for use in enrichment analysis with tools such as [GSEA](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16199517/) and [mitch](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32600408/).
In this pilot project, our focus was on human diseases including diabetes, heart disease, epilepsy and viral infection (SARS/MERS/SARS-CoV-2). 

## What gene signatures are available?

| Library       | No. sets |
| ----  |:----|
| Epilepsy      | 12 |
| Diabetes      | 129 |
| Heart disease | 50 |
| SARS,MERS,SARS-CoV-2 | 66 |

These gene sets are available in GMT format from the [DEE2 website](http://dee2.io/genesets.html)

## How were the gene signatures were created?

Methods used to generate the gene sets are given [here](doc/methods.md).
